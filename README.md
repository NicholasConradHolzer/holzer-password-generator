# Password Generator Starter Code

I've been heaving a real rough time readjusting to the school life so I've been super behind and for the third week in a row find myself working on an assignment within the last 10 hours before it's due; which I understand down the line is unprofesional and unpromissing but at the current time I'm more concerned with how much self loathing I felt juggling whether to start rushing through chapter four so I can have more time for that project and skipping another but I have a functional begining and maybe by turning in this; someone might be able to suggest how I can actually complete the password tool because I would definitely appriciate having one available.  I found many examples online and while I took inspiration from them I was very determined to make sure I was being 'original' with my approach to make sure I was at least understanding what I was implementing.  

So here it is; please go full force with criticism I hate that I couldn't figure out how to integrate the different character-type strings, as well as the extreme repition in logic.  I'm quite determined to comprehend all of this; I really am, I hope that is evident in the fact I can't stop hemming and hawing about the situation like this isn't making it worse; but its 11:59 pm and as an assignment its time L3 is out of my hands :(
